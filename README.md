# Module 2 Challenge

In this project, the active CLI has been updated to give users the ability to save their qualified loans to a .csv file. 
Users are now able to decide on the file name and which directory they wish to save to.

With loan information saved, users can adjust the entered income, credit scores, ect. and compare the qualified loan results with other past results.
